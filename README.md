# ZTM---Complete-Web-Dev

#### Zero to Mastery Course - Complete Web Developer 2022 (pretty much a Web Dev Bootcamp)

Enjoying it so far, nice theoretical section in beginning and going to be doing everything including basics like HTML & CSS, need my own notes on those since im handwriting everything now

Very happy so far in course - Advanced JS kicked my ass though..

Done with course, super good
