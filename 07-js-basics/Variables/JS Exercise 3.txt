// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

let first = prompt("Enter first number");
let mathSymbol = prompt("Pick one = + - / *");
let second = prompt("Enter second number");
let sum = Number(first) mathSymbol Number(second);
alert(sum);

Doesnt work, let cant be redeclared so ya, also cant get the symbol system wor work

Correct answer

var first = prompt("Enter first number");
var second = prompt("Enter second number");
var sum = Number(first) + Number(second);
alert("Sum is equal to " + sum);
