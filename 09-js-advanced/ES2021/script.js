// replaceALL = replace all occurences of a string, can assign to new variable

const str = "ztm is the best of the best";

str.replaceAll("best", "worst");

// returns ("ztm is the worst of the worst");

// replace - same thing but only did the first instance.

// also works on plain string thats not in var

"haha you are dumb haha".replaceAll("haha", "lol");
// returns ("lol you are dumb lol");
