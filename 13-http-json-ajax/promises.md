# Promises

- Introduced in ES6,
- A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future
- Either a resolved value or a reason it was not resolved
- 3 possible states for promise, Fulfilled, rejected, pending
- Previously callbacks were used instead of promises

.catch (catches any errors)
.then (can be chained, dont add semi colon after .then expression)
promise.all (takes in a array of promises that you provide the const names in a array ([1,2,3]))
