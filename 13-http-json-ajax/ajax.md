# AJAX

- Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Send data to a web server - in the background

## Methods to implement AJAX

### OLD - XHR

Convoluted way to do it

### OLD ish - jQuery

Much more succint method

### NEW - Fetch

Very succint easy way to do it, fetch .then

## Promise

Fetch API returns a promise, have to use .then and convert to json

### CORS error

Fix - open new tab, type about:blank in address bar and press enter, now use dev tools on that page
